# Insurance Information Test API

A sample/test application that manages insurance information (mock data).

This API was developer as a showcase of my skills, so it is not ready for real-world usage.

If you wish to follow my decisions during the development process, see the [DevLog](DevLog.md).

## Using the API

If you wish to use this API as an end-user, please see the endpoint [`/api-docs`](http://localhost:3000/api-docs) or the [swagger file](/src/swagger.json).

## Launch the API

To start the API use the command:

`npm run launch`

You should see the following output on your terminal:

```bash

```

## Testing

To run the Unit and Integration tests use the command:

`npm run test`
